# verybasicosuaimassist
My very first project that is outside of my comfort zone, It works by scanning my monitor and searching for the specified colors given in the code. Do keep in mind that it is very very buggy and you should keep changing the brightness and the target color in the main.py file. Keep the background pitch black to avoid detecting other colors. (THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE TO GET BANNED WITH THIS)
